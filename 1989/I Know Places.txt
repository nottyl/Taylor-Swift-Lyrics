I I I I, I I I I I I I I,
I I I I I I I I, I I I I, I I
You stand with a hand on my waist line.
Good to see that we're out in blank side.
I can hear them whisper as we pass by,
It's a bad sign, bad sign.
Something happens when everybody finds out.
See the vulture circling in dark cloud.
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out.
It could burn out.
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes.
And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes.
And we run.
Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be.
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down.
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places.
I know places.
Lights flash on the run for the fences.
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it.
Loose lips sink all the damn time, not this time.
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it.
My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes.
And we run.
Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be.
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down.
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places.
They are the hunters, we are the foxes.
And we run.
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it.
My love.
Baby, I know places we won't be found and they'll be.
Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down.
'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places.
They take their shots, we're bulletproof.
I know places (I) And you know for me it's always you.
I know places (I) In the dead of night, you act so great.
I know places (I) And, I know for you it's always me.
I know places.
