Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket.
You wore to the wrong part of town.
Desire is the sound of the whiskey.
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?.
Passion is a passing thing.
It's accidental chemistry.
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire.
It ain't what you and I are at all.
Oh, it's a need, it's a need.
I would go anywhere that you lead.
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow.
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go".
I won't leave, it's a need.
Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck.
That tell me to run or to freeze.
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else.
You forgot about me.
Passion is a passing thing.
It's accidental chemistry.
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving.
This is like breathing for me.
Oh, it's a need, it's a need.
I would go anywhere that you lead.
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow.
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go".
I won't leave, it's a need.
Baby, it's always.
A new kiss every time we do this.
The truth is.
It's essential to me.
That you love me more than.
Wishing, longing.
Oh, it's a need (It's a need), it's a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah).
I would go (I would go) anywhere (Anywhere) that you lead (Oh, oh).
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (Burning slow).
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go".
I won't leave (I won't leave), it's a need (Oh) .
