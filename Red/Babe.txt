What about your promises, promises? What about your promises, promises, promises? No.
What a shame.
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah.
Big mistake.
You broke the sweetest promise that you never should have made.
I'm here on the kitchen floor.
You call, but.
I won't hear it.
You said, "No one else" How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?) You really blew this, babe.
We ain't getting through this one, babe.
This is the last time.
I'll ever call you babe (This is the last time, this is the last time) This is the last time.
I'll ever call you babe.
What a waste.
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah.
And it's strange how your face.
Doesn't look so innocent, your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe.
I break down every time you call.
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball.
We said, "No one else" How could you do this, babe? (Oh) (What about your promises, promises?) You really blew this, babe.
We ain't getting through this one, babe.
This is the last time.
I'll ever call you babe (This is the last time, this is the last time) This is the last time.
I'll ever call you.
Since you admitted it (oh) I keep picturing (oh) Her lips on your neck (oh) I can't unsee it (oh) I hate that because of you.
I can't love you, babe.
What a shame.
Didn't wanna be the one that got away.
How could you do this, babe? You really blew this, babe.
We ain't getting through this one, babe.
This is the last time.
I'll ever call you babe (This is the last time, this is the last time) This is the last time.
I'll ever call you babe.
I'm here on the kitchen floor.
You call but.
I won't hear it.
You said, "No one else" We ain't getting through this one, babe.
I break down every time you call.
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball.

What about your promises, promises?
