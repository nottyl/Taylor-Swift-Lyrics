Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me? When we were younger down in the park.
Honey, making a lark of the misery.
You got shiny friends since you left town.
A tiny screen's the only place.
I see you now.
And.
I got nothing but well-wishes for ya.
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was.
Ooh, but you don't like it that way.
It's never too late to come back to my side.
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in.
Tupelo.
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know.
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh) Dorothea (Ah-ah) Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines.
Ooh, from you.
I'd buy anything.
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me? When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes.
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya.
But are you still the same soul.
I met under the bleachers? Well… Ooh, I guess.
I'll never know.
Ooh, and you'll go on with the show.
But it's never too late to come back to my side.
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in.
Tupelo.
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know.
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh) Dorothea (Ah-ah) Ooh, ooh.
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah) Ah-ah.
Ooh.
